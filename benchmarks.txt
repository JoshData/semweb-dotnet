2006-11-26 v0.77 (pre-release)
Same setup as below.
Loading:
	mysql-5.0.22: 	28min; 4,101 stmt/sec; 720MB db; 109 bytes/stmt
Querying:
	Time includes program start-up; there may be caching getting in the way.
	RDFS reasoning is used.
	query	time (s)	notes
	1		1.7			large input, high selectivity, no reasoning
	3		0.9			low input, no reasoning
	4		1.2			small input, high selectivity, subClassOf/subPropertyOf reasoning
	5		1.3			large input, high selectivity, subClassOf/subPropertyOf reasoning
	6		~10s		large input, low selectivity, no reasoning
	7		1.3			small input, high selectivity, reasoning

2006-09-29 v0.751
System: 1.8 GHz AMD single processor, 1GB RAM; Mono runtime on Fedora Core 5
Benchmark: LUBM 1.7 w/ 50 universities: 6,890,640 statements in 1000 files totalling 540M
Loading:
	null: 			5min; 23,321 stmt/sec (just loading the data)
	N3 file: 		10min; 10,975 stmt/sec (loading and dumping to N3 file on disk)
	mysql-5.0.22: 	39min; 2,921 stmt/sec; 762MB db; 115 bytes/stmt
	sqlite-3.3.3: 	72min; 1,597 stmt/sec; 1.1GB db; 162 bytes/stmt
	postgresql-8.1:	94min; 1226 stmt/sec; 1.6GB db; 238 bytes/stmt
Querying:
	Time includes program start-up.
	No reasoning is used, and so only 3 queries from the test set can be run:
	This is pretty rough.  It might be unfairly low if things were cached between tests.
