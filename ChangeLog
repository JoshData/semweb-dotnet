	* Simplified the treatment of variables in queries:
	  N3Reader: Variables come in as anonymous nodes now,
	  and their names are given in the VariableNames IDictionary
	  of RdfReader.
	  QueryEngine: Only anonymous nodes are treated as variables.
	  RSquary: Variable names are set explicitly, and now it's
	  impossible to make a named node (i.e. with a uri) a variable.

	* GetHashCode() for anonmyous resources used to return
	  zero, which made hashtables of anonymous resources
	  very slow.  Now it returns Object.GetHashCode().
	* Fixes in the query engine, SQL store, and N3Reader.
	* Statements now have a default non-null Meta field. The
	  default is Statement.DefaultMeta.
	* Something has made SQLite stores much slower.
	* RdfXmlReader respects the RdfReader.Meta property.
	* MemoryStore.FindEntities wasn't working.
	* The SPARQL parser wasn't reading quoted literals or
	  numbers properly.

	* More bug fixes.
	* Query engine totally rewritten, which will
	  make much more sense once its documented.
	* Store.Contains now accepts statement templates.

2005-06-20 Version 0.501 Posted

	Just lots of bugs fixed.
	* New API to replace one statement with another statement in a store.
	* New API to test whether a statement template matches a statement.
	* The Resource class now has its == and != operators overloaded.
	* Store.CreateForInput/Output now accepts 'ntriples' 'nt' and 'turtle'.
	* Store.SelectSubjects signature change.
	* Select(Statement[]) for SQL stores works now.
	* SQLLite has a bug in how they handle LEFT JOIN.  SQL store now
	  works around this.
	* SQL stores now index on the meta field.
	* FindEntities works now.
	* N3Writer can output in NTriples, Turtle, or full N3 mode.
	* The query engine works now, and it's better optimized (but it wasn't working before anyway).
	* Xml (Sparql) query result output now has nice indentation.
