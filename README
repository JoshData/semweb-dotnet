The license basically means you can copy, distribute and
modify this package however you like, but you need to
give me due credit.  I think that's fair.  My interpretation
of this is that it applies to both the source and binary
form of the library.

For more information, open the README.xhtml file in a
web browser, or view the API docs in the apidocs directoy,
or other documentation in the doc directory.

Build instructions:

Run make if you're in Linux.  Otherwise, to build SemWeb.dll,
throw all of the .cs files in the src directory into a
VisualStudio project and compile.  Each .cs file in the
src.misc directory should be compiled into its own
assembly.

Other included files:

bin/sparql-core.dll is based on the SPARQL Engine by Ryan Levering,
which is covered by the GNU LGPL.  The original Java JAR was
coverted to a .NET assembly using IKVM (see below).
See: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparql/

bin/IKVM*.dll are auxiliary assemblies for running the SPARQL
engine.  IKVM was written by Jeroen Frijters.  See http://www.ikvm.net.
