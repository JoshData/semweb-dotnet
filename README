The license basically means you can copy, distribute and
modify this package however you like, but you need to
give me due credit.  I think that's fair.

For more information, open the README.xhtml file in a

or other documentation in the doc directory.

Build instructions:

Run make if you're in Linux.  Otherwise, to build SemWeb.dll,
throw all of the .cs files in the src directory into a
VisualStudio project and compile.  Each .cs file in the
src.misc directory should be compiled into its own
assembly.
