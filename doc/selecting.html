<h1>Selecting Statements</h1>

<h2>Using statement templates</h2>

<p>In the previous tutorial you saw the <tt>Select</tt> method of <tt>StatementSource</tt>s, which streams all of the statements into a sink.  The name "Select" was derived from SQL syntax, where it's used to retrieve rows that match a criteria.  In SemWeb, Select is used to retreive statements matching a filter.  (And as with SQL, when no criteria is given all statements are retrieved.)</p>

<p>A template is a <tt>Statement</tt> but with subject, predicate, and object possibly <tt>null</tt>.  <tt>null</tt>s are wildcards.  So here are a few examples:</p>

<pre class="code">
store.Select(sink);  // selects all statements, streaming them into sink
store.Select(new Statement(null, null, null), sink);  // the same
store.Select(Statement.All, sink);  // the same, but shorthand

store.Select(new Statement(subj, null, null), sink);  // any statement with that particular subject entity
store.Select(new Statement(subj, pred, null), sink);  // any statement with that particular subject and predicate
store.Select(new Statement(subj, pred, obj), sink);  // just that statement, if it exists in the store
</pre>

<p>The sink can be any <tt>StatementSink</tt>.  This includes <tt>RdfWriters</tt>, which would let 
you write out just a part of a store to a file, and <tt>Stores</tt> like the <tt>MemoryStore</tt>
so that you can move statements between data sources.</p>

<p>Stores provide a few convenience methods.  Two methods are provided for getting all of the subjects found with a given predicate and object, and similarly all objects found with a given subject and predicate.  This can be used to move around in a graph:</p>

<pre class="code">
foreach (Resource r in store.SelectObjects(person, foafname))
	Console.WriteLine("His name is: " + r);
</pre>

<p>Other convenience methods are overrides of Select that rather than sending the results to a sink, load them into memory so that you may for-each over them:</p>

<pre class="code">
foreach (Statement statement in store.Select(new Statement(null, rdftype, foafPerson))) {
	...
}
</pre>

<p>You obviously shouldn't use these on data sources of unbounded size as you wouldn't necessarily want to load the results all into memory.</p>

<p>These convenience methods are only provided in the <tt>Store</tt> class and its subclasses.
If you want to use them on data from a file or other data source that doesn't extend <tt>Store</tt>,
load the data into a <tt>MemoryStore</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
Store store = new MemoryStore();
store.Import(RdfReader.LoadFromUri(new Uri("http://dannyayers.com/misc/foaf/foaf.rdf")));
</pre>

<p>Here's an example program that loads a FOAF document and extracts some information using Select:</p>

<pre class="code" file="../examples/select.cs">using System;
using SemWeb;

public class Select {
    const string RDF = "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#";
    const string FOAF = "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/";
    
    static readonly Entity rdftype = RDF+"type";
    static readonly Entity foafPerson = FOAF+"Person";
    static readonly Entity foafknows = FOAF+"knows";
    static readonly Entity foafname = FOAF+"name";

    public static void Main() {
        Store store = new MemoryStore();
        store.Import(RdfReader.LoadFromUri(new Uri("http://dannyayers.com/misc/foaf/foaf.rdf")));
        
        Console.WriteLine("These are the people in the file:");
        foreach (Statement s in store.Select(new Statement(null, rdftype, foafPerson))) {
            foreach (Resource r in store.SelectObjects(s.Subject, foafname))
                Console.WriteLine(r);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();

        Console.WriteLine("And here's RDF/XML just for some of the file:");
        using (RdfWriter w = new RdfXmlWriter(Console.Out)) {
            store.Select(new Statement(null, foafname, null), w);
            store.Select(new Statement(null, foafknows, null), w);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();    
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Other notes</h2>

<p>RDF collections, like Bag, Alt, and Seq, in RDF/XML use a strange
<tt>rdf:li</tt> pseudo-property.  <tt>rdf:li</tt> isn't actually a
property.  It is an abbreviation for <tt>rdf:_1</tt>, <tt>rdf:_2</tt>,
etc. in that order.  Thus when you select for members of a collection,
you can't use <tt>rdf:li</tt>.  However, RDFS defines the property
<tt>rdfs:member</tt> which <tt>rdf:_##</tt> properties are all
subproperties of.  The SemWeb stores all recognize the <tt>rdfs:member</tt>
predicate and will match it to any of the <tt>rdf:_##</tt> predicates.<p>

<p>In addition, the <tt>SelectObjects</tt> method of the <tt>Store</tt>
class will automatically sort the objects by their collection order,
where possible, when you call the method with the <tt>rdfs:member</tt> predicate.</p>

<p>Here's an example of that:</p>

<pre class="code" file="../examples/containers.cs">// This example deals with RDF containers.  You can use the rdfs:member
// property to match any rdf:_### (i.e. rdf:li) property.  Or,
// use SelectObjects on the Store, which will return the items
// in sorted order.

using System;
using SemWeb;

public class Containers {

    const string RDF = "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#";
    const string RDFS = "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#";
    
    public static void Main() {
        MemoryStore store = new MemoryStore();
        
        Entity container = new Entity("http://www.example.org/#container");
        
        store.Add(new Statement(container, RDF+"type", (Entity)(RDF+"Bag")));
        store.Add(new Statement(container, RDF+"_3", (Literal)"Three"));
        store.Add(new Statement(container, RDF+"_2", (Literal)"Two"));
        store.Add(new Statement(container, RDF+"_1", (Literal)"One"));
        
        // use the rdfs:member property to match for any rdf:_### predicates.
        Entity rdfs_member = (Entity)(RDFS+"member");
        
        using (RdfWriter writer = new TurtleWriter(Console.Out)) {
            writer.Namespaces.AddNamespace(RDF, "rdf");
            store.Select(new Statement(container, rdfs_member, null), writer);
        }
        
        foreach (Resource r in store.SelectObjects(container, rdfs_member))
            Console.WriteLine(r);
    }
}
</pre>
