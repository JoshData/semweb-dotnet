<h1>Library Overview</h1>

<p>SemWeb is a .NET library for working with
Resource Description Framework (RDF) data. It provides
classes for reading, writing, manipulating, and querying RDF.
The library does not provide any special tools for
OWL ontologies. That is, the library is a general-purpose
framework for dealing with RDF statements (i.e. triples).</p>

<p>The primary classes in the library are in the <tt>SemWeb</tt>
namespace. In that namespace, four classes provide the fundamentals
for all aspects of the library: <tt>Resource</tt>, <tt>Statement</tt>,
<tt>StatementSource</tt>, and <tt>StatementSink</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>MemoryStore</tt> class and the <tt>SelectableSource</tt>
interface are also discussed below.</p>

<h3>Resources and Statements</h3>

<p><tt>Resource</tt> is the abstract base class of the terms in RDF.
The RDF formal model has two types of terms, nodes and literal values,
and likewise <tt>Resource</tt> has two subclasses: <tt>Entity</tt>
and <tt>Literal</tt>. Nodes, whether they be named (i.e. URIs) or blank
(i.e. anonymous), are represented by the <tt>Entity</tt> class.
Named nodes are represented by <tt>Entity</tt> objects directly, while
blank nodes are represented by the <tt>BNode</tt> class, which is a
subclass of <tt>Entity</tt>. Literal values are represented by the
<tt>Literal</tt> class.</p>

<p>A RDF triple is represented by the <tt>Statement</tt> struct.
This type is a struct, rather than a class, because it is the
number of statements that an application will have to process
that is the most likely to be subject to scalability concerns.
That is, an RDF database can contain billions of triples, but
usually won't have nearly so many unique resources. The <tt>Statement</tt>
struct has three main fields: <tt>Subject</tt>, <tt>Predicate</tt>,
amd <tt>Object</tt>. Following the RDF specification, the subject
and predicate of a triple cannot contain literal values, and thus
those fields are typed as <tt>Entity</tt>, while an object can
be a triple, so the object field is typed as <tt>Resource</tt>.
It is thus often necessary to cast values when processing statement
objects to get an Entity or Literal value back from a statement.</p>

<p>To construct a triple, use <tt>Statement</tt>'s three-arg constructor:</p>

<pre class="code">new Statement(
	new Entity("http://www.example.org/SemWeb"),
	new Entity("http://www.example.org/hasName"),
	new Literal("My Semantic Web library!") );</pre>

<p>Note that constructing URI nodes involves calling <tt>Entity</tt>'s
constructor and passing a string. (Validation that the string is a
legitimate URI is not performed. That is the responsibility of the caller.)
To construct blank nodes, you must instantiate the <tt>BNode</tt> class:</p>

<pre class="code">new Statement(
	new Entity("http://www.example.org/SemWeb"),
	new Entity("http://www.example.org/relatedTo"),
	new BNode() );</pre>

<p>When adding statements into a store, no fields of a <tt>Statement</tt>
may be null.</p>

<p>While all instances of an Entity constructed by passing a URI are
considered equal so long as their URIs are equal, no two BNode object
instances are considered equal (mostly). You must create a single
BNode instance with "new BNode()" and use that instance throughout
to refer to the same BNode at different times.</p>

<p>It is possible to create literal values with a language tag or
datatype. To do so, use the three-arg <tt>Literal</tt> constructor:</p>

<pre class="code">new Literal("My Semantic Web library!", "en_US", null);
new Literal("1234", null, SemWeb.Constants.Namespace.XMLSCHEMA + "integer");</pre>

<p>A literal value may not have both a language and a datatype, following
the RDF spec.</p>

<p><tt>Statement</tt>s actually have a fourth field, called Meta, which
may be used for any purpose. It is envisioned to attach context information
to a statement. The Meta field must be an <tt>Entity</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>Resource</tt> class hierarchy has a fourth subclass.
<tt>Variable</tt> is a subclass of <tt>BNode</tt> and represents
a variable in a query. It is meant to be used only in queries.</p>

<h3>StatementSource and StatementSink</h3>

<p>Places where you get statements from are <tt>StatementSource</tt>s. 
This is an interface that has a method called <tt>Select</tt> whose 
purpose is to stream some statements to an object (a 
<tt>StatementSink</tt>) that is equipt via a method called <tt>Add</tt> to receive those statements. The approach taken 
here is an alternative to using the iterator paradigm for scanning 
through a set of statements. Rather, it is a source/sink type of
paradigm, if such a thing exists.</p>

<p>Let's start with the <tt>StatementSink</tt>. If you want to process
a set of statements, you will need to write a class that implements
this interface, by adding the method:</p>

<pre class="code">public bool Add(Statement statement) {
	...
}</pre>

<p>You could create a private nested class to implement the interface,
for instance. Inside this method, you place your code to process a single
statement. If you need to see more than one statement at once,
you could place code in there to put the statement into an ArrayList,
and then later on process all of the statements in the ArrayList,
for instance. (Or just use a MemoryStore in the first place: more
on that later.) Return <tt>true</tt> at the end, or <tt>false</tt>
to signal the caller to stop sending statements.</p>

<p><tt>StatementSink</tt> is implemented by the file-writing classes,
including the RDF/XML writer (<tt>RdfXmlWriter</tt>), N-Triples writer (<tt>NTriplesWriter</tt>), Turtle writer (<tt>TurtleWriter</tt>), and N3 writer
(<tt>N3Writer</tt>).</p>

<p>The <tt>StatementSource</tt>, on the other hand, is the object with 
the statements that you want to access. File-reading classes like the 
RDF/XML and N3 readers (<tt>RdfXmlReader</tt> and <tt>N3Reader</tt>) 
implement this interface. It contains a method <tt>Select</tt> to which 
you pass your <tt>StatementSink</tt> to begin sending the statements 
from the source into the sink, with the sink's <tt>Add</tt> method 
called for each statement. (Select is named after the SQL command of the 
same name.)</p>

<pre class="code">source.Select(new MySink());</pre>

<h3>MemoryStore</h3>

<p>The <tt>MemoryStore</tt> class is an in-memory storage
object for statements. At its core, it is just an <tt>ArrayList</tt>
of statements. This class (and actually all
<tt>Store</tt> classes) are peculiar from the point of view
of the class hierarchy discussed so far: It implements
both <tt>StatementSource</tt> and <tt>StatementSink</tt>.
Thus you can add statements to it by calling its <tt>Add</tt>
method. You can also get statements out of it by calling its
<tt>Select(StatementSink)</tt> method, which will stream statements
into any <tt>StatementSink</tt> (including another MemoryStore,
a file-writing class, or one of your own classes, for instance).</p>

<pre class="code">MemoryStore ms1 = new MemoryStore();
ms1.Add(new Statment(.....);
MemoryStore ms2 = new MemoryStore();
ms1.Select(ms2);</pre>

<p>But the <tt>MemoryStore</tt> can also be used as a utility class
for moving from the source-sink paradigm to an iterator paradigm.
The class implements <tt>IEnumerable</tt> and
<tt>IEnumerable&lt;Statement&gt;</tt>, which means you can <i>foreach</i>
over them to iterate through the statements they contain. You need
to keep in mind scalability issues here, though. Streaming statements
into a MemoryStore means you are loading them all into memory, which
may not be possible for large applications.</p>

<pre class="code">MemoryStore ms = new MemoryStore();
datasource.Select(ms);
foreach (Statement stmt in ms)
    Console.WriteLine(stmt);</pre>
	
<h3>SelectableSource</h3>

<p>The <tt>SelectableSource</tt> is another part of the core
of the library. This interface extends <tt>StatementSource</tt>
with two new <tt>Select</tt> methods. Recall the <tt>Select(StatementSink)</tt>
method already introduced which streams <i>all</i> statements from the source
into the sink. The <tt>MemoryStore</tt> and other data sources use the
<tt>SelectableSource</tt> interface to provide a basic filtering
mechanism on the statements that are streamed back. These methods are:</p>

<pre class="code">void Select(Statement template, StatementSink sink);
void Select(SelectFilter filter, StatementSink sink);</pre>

<p>In the first method, the caller provides a "statement template".
Unlike statements added into stores, these statements may have
null fields for subject, predicate, or object. Those fields are
then treated as wildcards, and the fields that have values are
applied as filters. Filtering with <tt>new Statement(x, null, null)</tt>
will stream to the sink only statements whose subject is <tt>x</tt>.
While of course you could use the simpler <tt>Select(sink)</tt> call and
filter the statements in your sink yourself,
this wouldn't scale when the data source has billions of other
irrelevant triples:</p>

<pre class="code">// streams just statements that have mySubject as the subject
source.Select(new Statement(mySubject, null, null), new MySink());

// streams just statements that have myPredicate and myObject as the predicate and object
source.Select(new Statement(null, myPredicate, myObject), new MySink());</pre>

<p>This template paradigm is useful when you want to get the statements
that match some other statement. It is also used by the <tt>Contains(Statement)</tt> method.</p>

<p>The <tt>SelectableSource</tt> interface's second new Select method
takes a <tt>SelectFilter</tt> object as its first argument. An object
of this class provides more control over the statements selected. In
particular, it allows for statements in which the subject, predicate, or
object can range over a list of values, rather than just a single value
as with the template paradigm. Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="code">SelectFilter filter = new SelectFiler();
filter.Subjects = new Entity[] { entity1, entity2, entity3 };
filter.Predicates = new Entity[] { dc_title, rdfs_subject };

// streams statements who have any of the listed entities as
// the subject, and any of the listed predicates as the object
source.Select(filter, new MySink());</pre>

<p>The primary advantage of this second Select method is that it
is more efficient to query out-of-memory databases as few times
as possible, getting as many results in one shot, than repeatedly
querying the data source for different triples.</p>
