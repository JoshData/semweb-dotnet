<h1>Reading RDF</h1>

<p>Reading RDF files is pretty easy so here are a few examples.</p>

<p>This loads an RDF/XML file into a MemoryStore:</p>

<pre class="code">
MemoryStore store = new MemoryStore();
store.Import(new RdfXmlReader("data.rdf"));
</pre>

<p>This loads a N-Triples, Turtle, or Notation 3 file into a store:</p>

<pre class="code">
store.Import(new N3Reader("data.n3"));
</pre>

<p>This loads a RDF file from the web:</p>

<pre class="code">
store.Import(RdfReader.LoadFromUri(new Uri("http://www.mozilla.org/news.rdf")));
</pre>

<p><tt>LoadFromUri</tt> will determine the format of the file (XML, Turtle, etc.) based on the MIME type sent back from the server, or if that fails, the file extension.</p>

<p>You don't have to put the contents of a file into memory.  All of the <tt>RdfReader</tt>s are "streaming", which means it doesn't need to load the entire file before getting statements out of it.  The reader can stream statements to a "sink" as soon as each is read.</p>

<p>In fact, readers are one type of <tt>StatementSource</tt>.  <tt>StatementSource</tt>s provide a <tt>Select</tt> method which streams statements to a <tt>StatementSink</tt>, providing a corresponding <tt>Add</tt> method.</p>

<p>Stores are one type of sink.  You saw the <tt>MemoryStore</tt>'s Add method in the last tutorial.</p>

<p>The following is pretty much equivalent to the code above:</p>

<pre class="code">
RdfReader webrdf = RdfReader.LoadFromUri(new Uri("http://www.mozilla.org/news.rdf"));
webrdf.Select(store);
</pre>

<p>For a <tt>MemoryStore</tt>, there is no difference.  Other stores may override <tt>Import</tt> with transaction or locking mechanics to speed up the process of loading a large data file.</p>

<p>By creating your own sink, you can process statements in a streaming way:</p>

<pre class="code">
class StatementPrinter : StatementSink {
    public bool Add(Statement assertion) {
        Console.WriteLine(assertion.ToString());
        return true;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This class implements a sink that simply prints out each statement to the console as each statement is received.  It returns <tt>true</tt> to indicate to the source to continue.  Returning <tt>false</tt> would end the streaming.</p>

<p>The <tt>Statement</tt> type is a <i>struct</i> that contains three fields:
<tt>Subject</tt>, <tt>Predicate</tt>, and <tt>Object</tt> (actually it contains
a <tt>Meta</tt> field too).  Since RDF statements only have entities as
subjects and predicates, the first two fields are typed as <tt>Entity</tt>,
while the last field is typed as <tt>Resource</tt>.  If you want to
access the URIs and literal values within the statement, you might write
something like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
Console.WriteLine("Subject: " + assertion.Subject.Uri);
Console.WriteLine("Predicate: " + assertion.Predicate.Uri);
if (assertion.Object is Entity)
    Console.WriteLine("Object: " + ((Entity)assertion.Object).Uri + " (it's an entity)");
else
    Console.WriteLine("Object: " + ((Literal)assertion.Object).Value + " (it's a literal)");
</pre>

<p>Of course, beware that BNodes are entities without URIs, and the <tt>Uri</tt>
property will return <tt>null</tt> in that case.</p>

<p>To stream the statements from the web directly to the custom sink, use:</p>

<pre class="code">
webrdf.Select(new StatementPrinter());
</pre>

<p>There's one final twist.  Stores, as I mentioned, are a type of sink, letting you stream 
statements into them.  They are simultaneously a type of source!  This lets you stream statements 
out of them too, just as you stream statements out of the <tt>RdfXmlReader</tt> and into your
own class.</p>
