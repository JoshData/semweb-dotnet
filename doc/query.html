<h1>Querying</h1>

<p>This page provides an example for running queries against RDF data
using SemWeb.  Two query methods are supported.  The first is the
GraphMatch engine which matches a simple graph with no disjunctions
or optional edges against the target data.  The second method is
SPARQL queries (SELECT only).  At the end, I give overview of the design
of the GraphMatch engine.</p>

<h2>Getting the data</h2>

<p>We'll use an RDF description of the people in the U.S. Congress
for this example.  Download the data files at
<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/data/rdf/people.rdf.gz">http://www.govtrack.us/data/rdf/people.rdf.gz</a>,
<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/data/rdf/bills.108.rdf.gz">http://www.govtrack.us/data/rdf/bills.108.rdf.gz</a>, and
<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/data/rdf/bills.108.cosponsors.rdf.gz">http://www.govtrack.us/data/rdf/bills.108.cosponsors.rdf.gz</a>
and un-gzip them.  (I'm the author of those files.)</p>

<p>To simply some things, we'll put the contents of these three files into a single Notation3 file using the following command.  (You may need to adjust the path to <tt>rdfstorage.exe</tt>.
It'll be compiled by <tt>make</tt> into the <tt>bin</tt> directory of the SemWeb package.)</p>

<pre class="code">
mono rdfstorage.exe --out n3:congress.n3 people.rdf bills.108.rdf bills.108.cosponsors.rdf
</pre>

<p><tt>rdfstorage.exe</tt> reads RDF files into
a StatementSink, either an RdfWriter or a Store.  The default is to read files in Rdf/Xml format (with the RdfXmlReader).  We specified the output as <tt>n3:congress.n3</tt>, which means to write the data in Notation3 format to the file <tt>congress.n3</tt>.  The command outputs the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
people.rdf 0m4s, 101448 statements, 20393 st/sec
bills.108.rdf 0m9s, 173608 statements, 19128 st/sec
bills.108.cosponsors.rdf 0m7s, 153082 statements, 20871 st/sec
Total Time: 0m21s, 428138 statements, 20000 st/sec
</pre>

<h2>Writing the GraphMatch Query</h2>

<p>The first query method is the GraphMatch method using my own "RSquary" query format.
I like RSquary because the query
itself is written in any RDF format (think RDF-squared query).  A
simple RSquary query is just a graph to be matched against the target
data model, here in Notation 3 format:</p>

<pre class="code">
@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .
@prefix bill: &lt;urn://govshare.info/rdf/usbill/&gt; .

?bill rdf:type bill:Bill .
?bill bill:congress "108" .
?bill bill:type "s" .
?bill bill:number "1024" .

?bill bill:cosponsor ?person .
?person foaf:name ?name .
</pre>

<p>A benefit of using N3 is that it allows entity names starting with "?",
which RSquary can 'safely' assume are variables in the query.  Anything
else with a URI, unless otherwise specified, refers to the entity
with that URI (duh).  Anonymous (blank) nodes are also automatically
considered variables.  The query above says: Find all bindings
for the variables <tt>?bill</tt>, <tt>?person</tt>, and <tt>?name</tt>
such that 1) <tt>?bill</tt> is a bill in Congress identified by 108/s/1024,
2) <tt>?bill</tt> has <tt>?person</tt> as one of its cosponsors,
and 3) <tt>?name</tt> is a name of <tt>?person</tt>.</p>

<p>Save the above query as <tt>people_query.n3</tt>.</p>

<h2>Running the Query</h2>

<p>SemWeb contains a program called <tt>rdfquery.exe</tt> which runs
a RSquary query against a target data model.  To run the query:</p>

<pre class="code">
mono rdfquery.exe n3:congress.n3 < people_query.n3
</pre> 

<p><tt>rdfquery.exe</tt> outputs the results by default in the standard
SPARQL result XML format.  Here's the output.  The
query took about five seconds to complete, although I get much better
performance using a MySQL (>=4.0)-backed store.</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;sparql xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/rf1/result"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;variable name="bill" /&gt;
    &lt;variable name="person" /&gt;
    &lt;variable name="name" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;results&gt;
    &lt;result&gt;
      &lt;bill uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/108/bills/s1024" /&gt;
      &lt;person uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/people/C000880" /&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Michael Crapo&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;result&gt;
      &lt;bill uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/108/bills/s1024" /&gt;
      &lt;person uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/people/C001041" /&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;result&gt;
      &lt;bill uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/108/bills/s1024" /&gt;
      &lt;person uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/people/M001153" /&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Lisa Murkowski&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;result&gt;
      &lt;bill uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/108/bills/s1024" /&gt;
      &lt;person uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/people/M001111" /&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Patty Murray&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;result&gt;
      &lt;bill uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/108/bills/s1024" /&gt;
      &lt;person uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/people/L000174" /&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;result&gt;
      &lt;bill uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/108/bills/s1024" /&gt;
      &lt;person uri="urn://govshare.info/data/us/congress/people/S000148" /&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
  &lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/sparql&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Writing the SPARQL Query</h2>

<p>SemWeb uses the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sparql/">SPARQL query engine by Ryan Levering</a>.
At the time of this writing, version 0.5 of that library, released August 31, 2005, is being used.  That
library is written in Java, but for SemWeb I convert it to a .NET assembly using <a href="http://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM</a>. Only SELECT statements are supported by SemWeb now.</p>

<p>The advantage of SPARQL over RSquary is that it supports much more complex queries, including
optional statements and disjunctions (unions).</p>

<p>The query above in SPARQL is:</p>

<pre class="code">
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
PREFIX bill: <urn://govshare.info/rdf/usbill/>
SELECT ?bill ?person ?name
WHERE {
	?bill rdf:type bill:Bill .
	?bill bill:congress "108" .
	?bill bill:type "s" .
	?bill bill:number "1024" .
	?bill bill:cosponsor ?person .
	?person foaf:name ?name .
	}
</pre>

<p>Put that in <tt>people_query.sparql</tt> and then run it with:</p>

<pre class="code">
mono rdfquery.exe -type sparql n3:congress.n3 < people_query.sparql
</pre>

<p>This time the query takes quite a bit longer.</p>

<h2>RSquary Predicates</h2>

<p>RSquary has a few predicates that expand on the simple idea of graph matching.
Add the following to people_query.n3 to filter out names that don't
contain "Jon":</p>

<pre class="code">
@prefix query: &lt;http://purl.oclc.org/NET/rsquary/&gt; .
?name query:string-contains "Jon" .
</pre>

<p>RSquary recognizes query:string-contains as a "value filter."
Rather than matching that statement to the target model (which wouldn't
be good since query:string-contains isn't in the target model),
RSquary will instead filter the possible bindings for <tt>?name</tt>,
eliminating those that don't match the filter.</p>

<p>Other built-in value filters are lt, le, ne, eq, gt, and ge, in the
same namespace, with the obvious meanings.  The comparisons are string comparisons by
default, unless the object of the filter is given a recognized
XML Schema data type, as in:</p>

<pre class="code">
?amount query:gt "100"^^&lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float&gt;
</pre>

<p>This forces a (slightly more expensive) numeric comparison, and assumes
that all of the possible values will be parsable with Decimal.Parse.  All
of the other standard XML Schema numeric types are handled the same way.
datetime, date, and time are converted to DateTime structs, and duration
is converted to and compared with TimeSpan.</p>

<h2>Programming with the Query Classes</h2>

<p>To run queries from within your application, you need to follow the
following steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assemble the query in RSquary (or SPARQL, if you're daring) format</li>
	<li>Create a new SemWeb.Query.QueryEngine, adding the statements and variables into the engine</li>
	<li>Create a QueryResultSink, which will receive each of the resulting bindings</li>
	<li>Run the query with the Query method of the QueryEngine</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're using RSquary, you can create the query engine as follows.</p>

<pre class="code">
// Load the query
string baseuri = "http://www.example.org/#"; // this doesn't really matter
RdfReader queryparser = new N3Reader("queryfile.n3");
queryparser.BaseUri = baseuri;

// Create the query engine
QueryEngine query = new RSquary(new MemoryStore(queryparser), baseuri);

// Make sure the ?abc variables in N3 are considered variables by the engine.
foreach (Entity var in queryparser.Variables)
	query.Select(var);
</pre>

<p>If you're using SPARQL, the process is slightly different:</p>

<pre class="code">
SparqlParser sparql = new SparqlParser(new StringReader("SELECT ?a ?b ...."));
QueryEngine query = sparql.CreateQuery();
</pre>

<p>Then you need to create a QueryResultSink.  If you want the results in SPARQL
XML format, just use the SparqlXmlQuerySink:</p>

<pre class="code">
QueryResultSink qs = new SparqlXmlQuerySink(Console.Out, baseuri);
</pre>

<p>Alternative, create your own:</p>

<pre class="code">
public class SimpleQuerySink : QueryResultSink {
	public override bool Add(VariableBinding[] result) {
		foreach (VariableBinding var in result)
			Console.WriteLine(var.Variable + " ==> " + var.Target);
		Console.WriteLine();
		return true; // false would mean to abort the query
	}
}

QueryResultSink qs = new SimpleQuerySink();
</pre>

<p>Then run the query:</p>

<pre class="code">
Store model = new MemoryStore(new N3Reader("sourcedata.n3"));
query.Query(model, qs);
</pre>

<h2>Query Engine Design</h2>

<p>The query engine is designed on the assumption that a Select call to
the target model is very expensive, and thus it makes (or tries to) the fewest
number of queries on the underlying data.  The tradeoff is that the entire
result set must be determined and kept in memory before any resulting bindings
can be returned to the caller.</p>

<p>The naive approach to building a query engine (ahhem, that is to say,
my first two attempts at writing the engine) is entity-based, where the
engine permutes through the possible bindings of the variables, outputting
only those permutations that satisfy the query model.  The trick to this
method is to figure out the most efficient order for permuting through
the variables (i.e. ?bill first and ?person second, or the other way around)
I found it difficult with this method to avoid running running many similar
selects on the target model, e.g.: (pseudocode)</p>

<pre class="code">
select ?name where &lt;uri-of-John-Kerry&gt; foaf:name ?name .
select ?name where &lt;uri-of-Jon-Corzine&gt; foaf:name ?name .
...
</pre>

<p>To be efficient, this must be collapsed into a single select:</p>

<pre class="code">
select ?name where ( &lt;uri-of-John-Kerry&gt; , &lt;uri-of-Jon-Corzine&gt;, or ...) foaf:name ?name .
</pre>

<p>taking advantage of the fact that it's considerably faster to do one query with
a disjunction than to union many separate queries, at least with
the SQL backends.</p>

<p>So rather than permuting through possible bindings, the query engine
is more statement oriented.  Instead of ordering the variables to minimize
the number of permutations to go through, the engine orders the statements
to minimize the number of matching statements at any given step.</p>

<p>To order the statements, the engine starts by selecting the statement
with the hypothesized fewest number of matches.  It figures that statements
with one variable will have fewer matches than statements with two variables,
and further statements with a non-variable subject and OWL-functional-property
predicate will have even fewer statements.  That statement will be selected
first.  Then the engine repeats the process to select the next best
statement, but any variables used in previous statements are considered
already known, or bound.  For instance, with:</p>

<pre class="code">
1) gov:Congress dc:hasPart ?something
2) ?something dc:hasPart ?anotherthing
3) ?anotherthing dc:title ?title
</pre>

<p>statement 1 will be chosen first because it has the fewest number of variables,
and so it's expected that the fewest number of statements will match it in
the target model.  That is, there won't be many things that are part of Congress,
compared to the number of pairs x,y for which y is a part of x.  Next,
one of statements 2 and 3 is chosen to go next.
Statements 2 and 3 have the same number of variables, but since the engine
has already seen ?something in a statment previously chosen, the possible
values for ?something are already constrained and so the number of matches
for 2 will likely be less than 3.  Statement 2 is chosen to go next,
and statement 3 last.</p>

<p>Doing the query in this order will result in asking the target model
only for those things that are part of Congress, and just for each of those
things what are their parts.  If statement 2 were chosen before statement 1,
then the target model would first be queried for all x,y pairs where x hasPart
y, and then after it would filter out the values for x that aren't a part of
Congress.  Much time would be wasted asking the target model about things that have
no relation to Congress.</p> 

<p>With the statements ordered, the engine then makes a single pass over the
statements, running as few selects as possible on the target model to
get the information it needs.  In this example, the engine will first
select on (gov:Congress dc:hasPart __) and will remember the resulting
possible bindings for ?something.  Let's call the possible bindings A, B
and C.  For statement 2, the engine runs
a single combined select using a disjunction for the subject (using
the Select overload that takes a Statement array as an argument).
The disjunction is over the possible bindings for ?something that it
determined from the previous statement:</p> 

<pre class="code">
select ?anotherthing where ( A , B , or C ) dc:hasPart ?anotherthing .
</pre>

<p>The resulting matches for ?anotherthing are paired up properly
with the bindings of ?something.  Where no statement matched, the
binding for ?something is discarded.</p>

<p>Besides ordering the statements efficiently, the trick to this method
is the bookkeeping to keep straight which bindings go with which other
bindings, e.g. which names go with which people.</p>

<h2>Leftovers</h2>

<p>The query engine supports optional statements, but I haven't described
how to use this yet.  I haven't implemented disjunctions in the query,
and I have no idea how to do that efficiently yet.</p>
