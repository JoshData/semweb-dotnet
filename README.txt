SemWeb: A Semantic Web Library for C#/.NET
==========================================

USAGE
-----

SemWeb is a library for use in other C# and .NET applications on either
Mono or Microsoft's .NET. The library comes as a collection of
.NET assemblies. There are two directories for the compiled assemblies:

	bin: Binaries compiled for .NET 1.1 (no generics).
	bin_generics: Binaries compiled for .NET 2.0 (generics).
	
Each directory contains the files:

	SemWeb.dll
		This is the core library.

	SemWeb.MySQLStore.dll, SemWeb.PostgreSQLStore.dll, SemWeb.SqliteStore.dll
		Assemblies providing SQLStore implementations for
		those RDBMSs. (details to be entered here later)
	
	SemWeb.Sparql.dll
		An assembly providing the SPARQL engine class. It requires
		the auxiliary assemblies listed next.
	
	IKVM.GNU.Classpath.dll, IKVM.Runtime.dll
	sparql-core.dll
		Auxiliary assemblies required for SPARQL.

	rdfstorage.exe
		A command-line tool for converting files between RDF formats
		and loading RDF files into databases.

	rdfquery.exe
		A command-line tool for running SPARQL and simple graph
		matching (in N3) queries against a data source.

	euler.exe
		A command-line tool for performing general rule-based
		reasoning.
		
	Mono.GetOptions.dll
		This library from Mono is a dependency of all of the command-line
		tools listed above.
	
	.mdb files are debugging symbol files for Mono. Running
	under MS .NET, they are useless. Running under Mono, they
	are optional unless you want debugging info in stack traces.

	To use any of the .dll assemblies, reference them in your
	project, and make sure they and any of their dependencies
	are findable at runtime (which in MS .NET is usually the
	case if you just reference them).

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

Run make if you're in Linux.  Nothing complicated here.  You'll need
Mono installed (and the MySQL/Connector and Sqlite Client DLLs for SQL 
database support, optionally).  It'll build .NET 1.1 binaries to the
bin directory and .NET 2.0 binaries with generics to the bin_generics
directory.

A MonoDevelop solution file (semweb.mds) and a Visual Studio 2005 solution
file (SemWeb.sln) are included too.  They build .NET 2.0 binaries with
generics to the bin_generics directory.

If you build the MySQL and SQLite .cs files, you'll need to reference 
MySQL's MySql.Data.dll and Sqlite Client assemblies (see www.mono-project.com).  Otherwise just leave out those .cs files.
Put MySql.Data.dll in a "lib" directory within the SemWeb directory.

The sources are set up with a conditional compilation flag "DOTNET2" so 
that the sources can be compiled for both .NET 1.1 and 2.0, taking 
advantage of generics.

In short, you can use the library if the program it is incorporated

IMPORTED FILES FROM OTHER PROJECTS & CREDITS
--------------------------------------------

sparql-core.dll is based on the SPARQL Engine by Ryan Levering,
which is covered by the GNU LGPL.  The original Java JAR was
coverted to a .NET assembly using IKVM (see below).  Actually, I've
made numerous changes to the library so it can take advantage of
faster API paths in SemWeb.
See: http://sparql.sourceforge.net/

IKVM*.dll are auxiliary assemblies for running the SPARQL
engine.  IKVM was written by Jeroen Frijters.  See http://www.ikvm.net.
The IVKM license is the zlib license, which is GPL compatible.

Euler.cs is adapted from Jos De Roo's JavaScript Euler inferencing
engine.  See: http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/ The original source
code (and thus this derived file) was licensed under the W3C Software
License, which is GPL compatible. The packaged SemWeb.dll contains
this source code, and is thus (as is) released under the GPL license
only (not the CC license).
